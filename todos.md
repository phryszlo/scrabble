### new list
- on single letter placement, remove the col || row empty value
- fix the dictionary 
  - make a data-structure
  - fix stuff
- get loading spinner doing something that makes sense
- add straight-up pass option, without swap
  - should there be a modal for options?
  - 
- wordiness popup should say more. just the current, maybe in a sentence, with definition? and score deets etc.
- last-play element should add (letter) after the t-l-s or whatever
  - you might consider tinting the tile for the duration
- scoring history log
  - and previous total field under last-play-value field
- split out player tile trays from console area for responsivity. don't want tile trays wrapping below the board on 4:3.
